In this section you will create your Flutter project and run the **Hello World** application with it. 

First run the following command to create your new project with empty template

```bash
flutter create -e open_diary_app
```

Once you run the command, it will create a Flutter project with the empty setup. 

If you run your application now by running the following command, you will see the Hello World application:

flutter run -d chrome
```
